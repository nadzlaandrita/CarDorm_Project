# CarDorm_Project

This is a class project for the Database System course which is being carried out in the third semester.

In this project, we are given the opportunity to create a database for car sales and purchase transactions called cArDorm. The party from the cArDorm wants in its database there are data tables from transactions, data tables from purchases, data tables from cars, data tables from staff, data tables from car brands, and data tables from customers. We are asked to create these tables and enter the data that has been prepared. In addition, we are also asked to make several simulations, so that it can be seen whether the database that has been created is correct or not.
